# WordPress Image Description Plugin - Project Summary

## Overview

I've successfully transformed your rough idea for a WordPress image description plugin into a comprehensive design with a focused MVP implementation plan. The project follows accessibility best practices and WordPress development standards to create a tool that helps make websites more inclusive for visually impaired users.

## Key Requirements Clarified

Through our systematic requirements clarification process, we established:

1. **User Interface**: Bulk action in WordPress Media Library
2. **Image Selection**: Filtering for images with/without existing alt text
3. **Test Mode**: Dedicated preview page for reviewing generated descriptions
4. **Configuration**: Settings page under WordPress Settings menu
5. **Permissions**: Administrators configure, editors/authors generate descriptions
6. **Error Handling**: Continue processing with failure reporting and retry mechanisms
7. **API Configuration**: Support for custom endpoints, models, and parameters
8. **Customization**: Custom prompt templates for description generation
9. **Performance**: Batch processing with progress tracking and cancellation

## Design Highlights

### Architecture
- **Clean separation of concerns** with 7 main components
- **WordPress integration layer** following platform conventions
- **Robust data models** with custom database tables for job tracking
- **Comprehensive error handling** with retry strategies
- **Security-first approach** with proper capability checks and data validation

### Key Components
- **Plugin Core**: Initialization and coordination
- **Media Library Integration**: Bulk actions and filtering
- **Settings Management**: API configuration and permissions
- **API Client**: OpenAI communication with error handling
- **Batch Manager**: Job coordination and progress tracking
- **Queue Processor**: Background processing (simplified for MVP)
- **Preview Page**: Test mode interface for review and approval

## MVP Implementation Plan

The implementation plan breaks down development into **10 incremental prompts**:

1. **Plugin Structure**: Foundation and activation hooks
2. **Settings Page**: API configuration interface
3. **API Client**: OpenAI communication layer
4. **Bulk Action**: Media Library integration
5. **Batch Processing**: Job management system
6. **Description Generation**: Core functionality
7. **Preview Page**: Test mode interface
8. **Production Mode**: Apply descriptions to media library
9. **Error Handling**: User feedback and retry logic
10. **Integration**: Wire everything together and test

### MVP Scope
**Included:**
- ✅ Complete settings and API configuration
- ✅ Media library bulk action integration
- ✅ Synchronous batch processing
- ✅ Test mode with preview and approval
- ✅ Production mode with direct application
- ✅ Essential error handling and user feedback

**Excluded from MVP** (future enhancements):
- Advanced background processing with Action Scheduler
- Real-time progress indicators
- Batch cancellation during processing
- Advanced retry strategies and analytics

## Technical Foundation

### Research-Informed Decisions
- **WordPress Plugin Patterns**: Following established conventions for bulk actions, settings API, and user permissions
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Proper handling of vision models, rate limiting, and error scenarios
- **Media Library Architecture**: Direct integration with WordPress attachment system and alt text storage
- **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG 2.1 compliant description generation with quality guidelines

### Security & Performance
- **API key encryption** and secure storage
- **Role-based access control** with WordPress capabilities
- **Input validation** and output escaping
- **Batch size optimization** for API rate limits
- **Error logging** and user-friendly messaging

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review the detailed design** at `design/detailed-design.md`
2. **Start implementation** following the checklist in `implementation/prompt-plan.md`
3. **Begin with Prompt 1**: Set up basic plugin structure and activation

### Implementation Workflow
Each prompt in the implementation plan:
- Builds incrementally on previous work
- Includes specific technical requirements
- Focuses on WordPress best practices
- Provides testable functionality at each step

### Future Enhancements
After MVP completion, consider adding:
- Advanced background processing with Action Scheduler
- Real-time progress tracking with AJAX updates
- Batch cancellation and pause/resume functionality
- Advanced analytics and usage reporting
- Multi-language support for international sites

## Success Criteria

The completed MVP will provide:
- **Accessibility improvement** through AI-generated alt text
- **User-friendly interface** integrated with familiar WordPress workflows
- **Reliable processing** with proper error handling and recovery
- **Flexible configuration** supporting various API providers and settings
- **Test-first approach** allowing review before applying changes

This foundation supports the core mission of making websites more accessible while providing a solid base for future feature development.
