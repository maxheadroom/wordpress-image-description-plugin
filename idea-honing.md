# WordPress Image Description Plugin - Requirements Clarification

This document captures the requirements clarification process for the WordPress image description plugin.

## Question 1: User Interface and Access

**Question:** How should users access this plugin functionality within the WordPress admin interface? Should it be:

- A dedicated admin page under "Tools" or "Media"
- Integrated directly into the existing Media Library interface
- A bulk action available from the Media Library list view
- A combination of the above approaches
- Something else entirely?

Consider the typical WordPress admin workflow and how users would most naturally discover and use this feature.

**Answer:** A bulk action available from the Media Library interface.

## Question 2: Image Selection and Filtering

**Question:** When users select images for description generation, should the plugin:

- Allow selection of any images from the media library (including those that already have alt text)
- Only show images that are missing alt text descriptions
- Provide filtering options to show both scenarios (with a toggle or filter)
- Focus specifically on images without existing alt text but allow override

**Answer:** It should provide filtering for both scenarios.

## Question 3: Test Mode Implementation

**Question:** For the test mode functionality you mentioned, how should the generated descriptions be presented to users for review? Should it be:

- A modal/popup window showing images with their generated descriptions side-by-side
- A dedicated preview page that lists all processed images with their descriptions
- An inline preview within the Media Library interface itself
- A combination approach where users can choose their preferred view

**Answer:** A dedicated preview page that lists all processed images with their descriptions.

## Question 4: Configuration Management

**Question:** For the configurable settings you mentioned (description length, API parameters), where should these be managed? Should it be:

- A dedicated settings page under WordPress Settings menu
- Part of the Media settings in WordPress admin
- Configured within the bulk action workflow itself
- A combination of global settings with per-operation overrides

**Answer:** A dedicated settings page under WordPress Settings menu.

## Question 5: User Role Permissions

**Question:** What user roles should have access to different aspects of the plugin? Should it be:

- Only administrators can configure settings and generate descriptions
- Administrators configure settings, but editors/authors can generate descriptions
- Configurable permissions where site owners can choose which roles have access
- Different permission levels (e.g., some users can only use test mode)

**Answer:** Administrators configure settings, but editors/authors can generate descriptions.

## Question 6: Error Handling and API Failures

**Question:** How should the plugin handle various error scenarios? Consider:

- API connection failures or timeouts
- Invalid API responses or rate limiting
- Images that cannot be processed (corrupted, unsupported formats)
- Partial failures when processing multiple images in bulk

Should the plugin:
- Stop processing and show an error for the entire batch
- Continue processing other images and report which ones failed
- Provide retry mechanisms for failed images
- Log errors for administrator review

**Answer:** Continue processing other images and report which ones failed and provide retry mechanisms for failed images.

## Question 7: API Configuration Details

**Question:** For the OpenAI-compatible API configuration, what specific parameters should be configurable? Should the plugin support:

- Custom API endpoints (for different providers like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, local models)
- Model selection (GPT-4 Vision, GPT-4o, Claude, etc.)
- Temperature and other generation parameters
- Rate limiting settings to avoid API quota issues
- Multiple API configurations (primary/fallback)

**Answer:** All of the above except the Multiple API configurations (primary/fallback).

## Question 8: Description Quality and Customization

**Question:** For the generated image descriptions, what level of customization should be available? Should the plugin support:

- Predefined description styles (brief, detailed, technical, creative)
- Custom prompt templates that users can modify
- Context-aware descriptions based on where images are used (blog posts, product pages, etc.)
- Tone/voice settings (professional, casual, accessible-focused)
- Language/locale support for non-English descriptions

**Answer:** Custom prompt templates that users can modify.

## Question 9: Performance and Processing

**Question:** For handling bulk operations and API calls, what performance considerations should be implemented? Should the plugin:

- Process images sequentially or in parallel batches
- Implement queue-based processing for large batches
- Show real-time progress indicators during processing
- Allow users to cancel ongoing operations
- Cache generated descriptions to avoid re-processing

**Answer:** Process images sequentially or in parallel batches and Implement queue-based processing for large batches and Allow users to cancel ongoing operations.
