## WCAG Guidelines for Alt Text

### WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria
- **1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)**: All non-text content must have text alternatives
- **1.4.5 Images of Text (Level AA)**: Avoid images of text when possible
- **1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception) (Level AAA)**: Images of text only for decoration

### Alt Text Principles

#### Informative Images
- Describe the essential information conveyed by the image
- Be concise but complete
- Consider context and purpose
- Avoid redundancy with surrounding text

#### Decorative Images
- Use empty alt attribute (alt="")
- Don't describe purely decorative elements
- Focus on functional content

#### Complex Images
- Provide brief alt text plus detailed description
- Use longdesc attribute or adjacent text
- Consider data tables, charts, diagrams

## Quality Criteria for Image Descriptions

### Length Guidelines
- **Brief**: 125 characters or less (ideal for most cases)
- **Detailed**: 125-250 characters (for complex images)
- **Extended**: 250+ characters (only when necessary)

### Content Guidelines
- Start with image type if relevant ("Photo of...", "Screenshot showing...")
- Include essential visual information
- Describe actions, emotions, and relationships
- Mention text that appears in images
- Avoid subjective interpretations

### Context Considerations
- **Blog posts**: Focus on relevance to article content
- **Product pages**: Emphasize features and benefits
- **News articles**: Include newsworthy details
- **Educational content**: Highlight learning objectives

## Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

### Good Alt Text Examples
```html
<!-- Good: Descriptive and contextual -->
<img src="chart.png" alt="Sales increased 25% from Q1 to Q2 2024, rising from $100K to $125K">

<!-- Good: Action-focused -->
<img src="button.png" alt="Submit form button">

<!-- Good: Decorative -->
<img src="border.png" alt="" role="presentation">
```

### Poor Alt Text Examples
```html
<!-- Bad: Too generic -->
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="image">

<!-- Bad: Redundant -->
<img src="dog.jpg" alt="Photo of a dog">
<p>This photo shows my dog playing in the park.</p>

<!-- Bad: Too verbose -->
<img src="sunset.jpg" alt="A beautiful, stunning, gorgeous sunset with orange and pink colors filling the sky above the ocean with waves gently lapping at the shore while seagulls fly overhead in this magnificent scene">
```
