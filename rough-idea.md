The idea is, to write a plugin for WordPress that let's a user select images from the WordPress Media Library and have the plugin generate image descriptions using an OpenAI compatible API. The image descriptions are meant to provide an alternative text for visually impaired people. The length of the description should be configurable in the plugin as well as the OpenAI API parameters like endpoint, credentials, model to use. 
The plugin should have a test mode in which the image descriptions are just generated and displayed along with the images, but not actually updated to the WordPress media library. Only upon confirmation or in 'production' mode the descriptions get updated to the respective items in the media library.
The plugin needs to be written in PHP as this is the WordPress default programming language.
